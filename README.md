-👋 Hi, I’m @augustinebuchi

-👀 I’m interested in NLP projects especially when it comes to ML models; talk about LLMs, robotics (a branch of AI), computer vision, Modeling using Inventor or Solid works, Prosthetics,- -IoT, and full-stack web development using Django and its rest framework and python.

-🌱 I’m currently perfecting my skills in ML model development and engineering, and Convolutional Neural Networks on computer Visions.

-💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Projects within the medical field and tech (biotech), computer vision model-related projects, and robotics projects, all the same.
